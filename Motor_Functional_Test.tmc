// THE JUMPERS ON THE BOARD MUST BE CLOSED!  
// Current set to 80% of the motor nominal current value in this example (100% is required to obtain the motor performance from the datasheet). 
// This program is set into 3 sections : 
// Section 1: definition of the parameters for the selected motor (current, acceleration,...)
// 			  Example: SAP 140,0,3 stands for: Set Axis Parameter N°140 of Axis (=motor) N°0 to value 3
// Section 2: slow continuous motion until a given position is reached
// Section 3: quick back and forth motion (dynamic motion)

SAP 179, 0, 1             //Set current range (Vsense), please let the jumpers on the board closed!
SAP 4,0,683				//Set Motor Velocity to approximate 1mm/s
SAP 6, 0, 92              //Set current = 80% of 250 mA, please let the jumpers on the board closed!
SAP 154, 0, 6             //Set Puls divisor (PD)(please refer to manual for equations and scales)
SAP 153, 0, 7			  //Set ramp divisor (please refer to manual for equations and scales
SAP 5, 0, 2047             //Set max acceleration speed 
SAP 140, 0, 2             //Set microstepping, 0= 1ustep/s, 1= 2usteps/s, 2= 4ustep/s, 3= 8usteps/s...
